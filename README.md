Greetings Chris and Adam! This repo provides a fully automated GitOps deployment of [Servas](https://hub.docker.com/r/beromir/servas) — a self-hosted Laravel-based link manager — using Rancher [Fleet](https://fleet.rancher.io/).

## Overview
- GitOps workflow using **Fleet**
- Helm-deployed Servas app + MariaDB
- Exposed through **NGINX Ingress** (also managed via Fleet)
- Fully local setup using Kubernetes (Kind, Docker Desktop, etc.)
- One-command deployment script
